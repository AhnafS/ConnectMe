## Frontend
The frontend was made using **React.js** and its various libraries, and **Tailwind.css**. It is fully responsive for both PC and Mobile and is visually appealing, while maintaining a simple navigatable design. 

## Backend
The backend was completly handled by Sanity. Sanity is a powerful Content Manegment System, it allowed me to setup the backend within minutes. By using its informative documentation, I was easily able to utilize this powerful tool and interact with it using my frontend application.
